3. [Services](https://arjoonn.pythonanywhere.com/services)
    - Two services are available as of now.
        1. Detect the presence of wheat / rice in images. This is illustrative of the power of machine learning. A similar classification can be made for classifying seeds as "will produce good crop" and "will produce bad crop"
        2. Detecting wheat seed type (Kama, Rosa and Canadian) based on the data provided by the user in a form. This illustrates another power of Machine learning, namely the cheap reproduction of decisions that people have to make.
    - It is recommended that you go a Google image search for `wheat` and provide an image with some wheat in it to the first form.
